					<h1>Which languages are spoken in the U.S.?</h1>
					<p>By Janaan Lake, Andreas Martinson, Rachel Berghout</a></p>
					<p>
						The visualization on the right shows each language in the United States represented by a circle. The largest circle is English in purple, followed by Spanish in orange.
						Each color represents a different language group. The U.S. language totals in order of size are: English, Spanish & Spanish Creole, Other Indo-European Languages, 
						Asian and Pacific Island Languages, and finally a 'catch-all' group called 'All Other Languages'. Hover over each circle to see a tooltip of that language with some details
						about the population size that speaks that language. 

						In the next visualization, we will look at the distribution of these languages across the U.S. Scroll down to see the distribution of languages broken out by state.
